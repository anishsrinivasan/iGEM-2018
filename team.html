                        <p class="card-text"> Pursuing a degree in Biotechnology, she's one of the top students in class and with good reason. She’s the true definition of alpha female and it’s why she’s the best leader our team could have. She’s decisive, brutally honest and realistic but she always racks her brains to make sure she’s fair. In the lab she takes point and makes sure everything proceeds perfectly and according to protocol. She’s a Science and Research junkie whose drug of choice is ‘The Human Body with all its intricacy, delicacy, perfection and balance'. Naturally she would like to pursue a career in healthcare. When she's not chasing international acclaim in the iGEM lab, Marcia loves to bake and Binge and blog about food. If you'd like to try out a new cuisine dish or restaurant in town, she's the person you'd like to talk to.
<br>
						Contributions: As a team leader, she works on wet lab and ensures the overall coordination of the team with respect to wet lab, modelling and HP.

He’d rather play than date. It’s as fairly impossible to name a series of sports that he hasn’t tried as it is to see him legitimately angry. His love extends from riding his bike and well into meaningful music. He can play the keyboard and guitar as well. As a guiding principle he holds that when in Rome, be Roman. Keep an ear out for his stories – they’re amusing.
<br>
						Contributions: He works on wet lab and ensures that the logistics of the iGEM related events stay as smooth as possible. He also serves as a team leader.

She’s enrolled as a PhD scholar in the department of Biotechnology. An associate editor of the department magazine, her tenure has seen an intersection of curricular and extracurricular activities. In recognition of her work, she was awarded the ‘Best all-rounder’ for the year 2010-2011. She owns an ability to think clearly and act quickly in testing circumstances, all the while donning a smile. She holds strong as a bridge between the laboratory work and project management.

She loves to be loaded with work all the time and sitting idle for more than few hours does not suit her. More of a visual person, she prefers movies and documentaries to books. Age does not hold her back while doing crazy stuff. She’s passionate about learning new languages which mostly happens by watching series and sometimes through classes. Europe and Seoul are her dream destinations. At last but not the least, she’s the "haengboghae" (be happy) type.

She’s a ball of diversity and an icon of intensity, usually seen juggling her technical and non-technical interests. Never short of words and food, she dispenses them with equal ease, often alarming those in proximity. She trudged into biotechnology with a heavy sense of purpose and waddled through campus with exceptionally short legs. She aims to become a quality control officer at a cosmetic lab in the future.

						Contributions: Currently pursuing her final year of B.Tech Biotechnology, she contributes in wet lab and is a member of the HP team.

As a final year student of his biotechnology undergraduate, his management and collaborative skills have stood the testimonies of time leaving a trail of research projects. He has experimented in the fields of nano-biotechnology, environmental biotechnology and plant biotechnology. When he’s not experimenting, he can be seen reading novels or listening to music with the same fervour. He seeks to explore cuisines and cultures as a part of his travel diaries one day.

						Contributions: He works extensively in the laboratory and is often seen discussing and helping troubleshoot experiments.

The comfort of the chaos amidst a myriad of mayhem has driven the eloquence in her – she’s an author who publishes her stories online. She’s passionately inclined towards finding the impossible, interested in uninterrupted learning and invested in making the world a much better place. She fancies making a lot of money and spending it all on nothing but trying to get fat.  Meet our own 5’4” Indian version of Erin Maers.

With an infectious smile and a spring in her steps, she skips through corridors and sleeps throughclasses. A gifted artist, her beautiful drawings elicit admiration for raw talent and appreciation of technique even from the laymen. She’s also a champion in solving Ravensburger puzzles and holds her 3000-piece puzzle close to her heart. She fancies owning the 5000-piece puzzle but alas her likes are quite expensive on the wallet. She aspires to become a successful entrepreneur one day and to afford all the puzzles in the world. 
<br>
						Contributions: She works on wet lab techniques and optimisation protocols.

With a flair for freezing time from behind his lens, he could catch you in one of your most questionable moments. When he’s not being an impatient soul, he morphs into a poet, whipping out beautiful verses. He’s a bike aficionado and proclaims that while four wheels move the body, two wheels move the soul.Within biotechnology, he prides himself on his expert plating skills and aspires to work with autism in the future.

                        <p class="card-text"> It is so easy to fall irrevocably in love with Science when one is around Khadija. She loves Biology for all its intricate details and the complexity that is so beautifully disguised. As a final year student of B.Tech Biotechnology, she strives for perfection in everything she does and believes that there is no substitute to dedication and hardwork. When she is not swamped with HP and Modelling work, she is at the iGEM lab lending her expertise to the wetlab team. In her downtime, she reads books, travels to new places, bakes the occasional cake and spends quality time with her dad. Ten years down the line, she hopes to be a successful teacher-researcher or maybe even manage her very own Science journal. However, some things will hopefully never change. She will probably still fancy herself some coffee ice-cream, read Jeffrey Archer's Kane and Abel for the 300th time, and still be befuddled by the beautiful mess that is Science.
<br>
						Contributions: She works on wet lab and contributes extensively in the design and execution of modelling objectives.

An aspiring molecular biologist who loves to read about things past, you’d never get past him if he finds you dog-earing the pages of his books. While the work of William Blake and George.R.R. Martin, leave him spell-bound, it’s the late Ayrton Senna who has his heart. If you’d ever judge him for always listening to music at an odd volume number, you’d be wrong just as you would be if you judged his appetite by looking at his size. He loves science as it holds the key to everything, and hopes that iGEM will be the key that will help him unlock his potential.
<br>
						Contributions: He contributes to wet lab experiments and was also a part of the  interlab team.

She has a wonderful work ethic and her calm demeanour, even when things hit the fan, is truly remarkable. She always stands up for what is right even if it’s the hardest thing she has to do. She’s served her time as the President of the Debating Union and can often be seen arguing with people over why they’re wrong and more importantly, why she’s right. Her passions in life include debating, research and food. She aims to do something that truly makes her happy.
